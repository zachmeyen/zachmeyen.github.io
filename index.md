### University of Kansas Machine Learning Competition | First Place
This competition was hosted by my university during my senior year of undergrad. It was co-hosted with the prominent Kansas City area analytics firm, Tradebot. The competition was primarily focused on Business Analytics students and computer science students. I was the only individual participating alone.

The grand prize was $1500 in cash. I won first place and promptly bought a $1500 bike at the local bike shop.

Since then, I've ridden that bike through 11 countries.
